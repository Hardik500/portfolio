        <p>
          I'm a web developer currently in the final year of my Bachelors's
          Course with a serious enthusiasm for learning new tech. It may be a
          framework, a library, or even a new programming language if it is to
          my liking I will try it out.
        </p>
        <p>
          My major focus lies in working with JavaScript on the full-stack side
          & love working on fast, responsive ,and dynamic pages. I also have
          skills in other fields like Web-Scraping using Python.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am interested in working on serverless technology, &
          exploring more on the cloud side.
